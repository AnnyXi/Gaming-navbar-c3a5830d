            <h3>Half-Life 3 confirmed</h3>
            <p>
                It is finally real. Since 1998, fans across the globe have been
                hoping for a conclusion to the Half-Life trilogy that was started
                ages ago.
                However, it was last Tuesday when it was announced that the game
                will be published next summer.
